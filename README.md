# seamcarving
Project done in ESC190: Data Structures and Algorithms. This implements the seamcarving algorithm featured in Photoshop and other image-adjustment programs. 

This program was written in C over the course of a week, and features both the header files and source code for the algorithm. To actually use it, pair the algorithm with a website to comvert any image to a .bin file, and run it!
